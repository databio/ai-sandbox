# Ideas

This is a space for brainstorming AI applications for lab work.

## How to Propose an Idea

1. Create a new markdown file in `proposed/` with a descriptive name (e.g., `automated-methods-writing.md`)
2. Use the template below
3. Commit and push—we'll discuss ideas periodically as a group

## Template

Copy this template for new ideas:

```markdown

## Potential Benefits

- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

## Questions / Unknowns

- What would we need to figure out?
- Any concerns?

## Effort Estimate

- [ ] Quick experiment (< 1 day)
- [ ] Small project (few days)

## Notes

Any other thoughts, links, or references.
