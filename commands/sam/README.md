Here are some commands/skills that help me with literature reviews and general topic research.

1. cite-papers: cite a list of doi numbers in the format Nathan had with his paper agents.
2. pdf-to-md: some papers can't be fetched by html easily due to them not being on pbmc. for papers I can fetch the pdf of manually instead, I have this command to parse the pdf paper contents and save as a markdown file.
3. research-report: use papers in the md folder of a collection directory and produce a report to answer a research topic of choice.
